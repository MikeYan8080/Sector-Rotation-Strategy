# Sector-Rotation-Strategy
In this program we investigate whether it is possible to earn excess return in ETF market using our sector rotation strategy. In general, our sector rotation strategy is to buy the ETFs based on the information of the last year. And we have designed four methods to perform our sector rotation strategy:
Method 1: Every year, buying ETFs with the highest holding period return in the last year.
Method 2: Every year, buying ETFs with the lowest holding period return in the last year.
Method 3: Every year, buying ETFs with the highest trading volume in the last year.
Method 4: Every year, buying ETFs with the lowest trading volume in the last year.
Later, we will use SPY and other sector ETFs data from 2009 to 2020 to test our rotation strategy.
